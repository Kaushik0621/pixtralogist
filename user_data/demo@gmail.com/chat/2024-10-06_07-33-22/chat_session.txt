User: give me a non veg meal idea for today lunch?
LLM: As a dietitian, I'd be happy to suggest a balanced non-vegetarian meal idea for your lunch. Here's a simple and nutritious option featuring chicken, which is a good source of lean protein:

**Grilled Chicken Salad with Quinoa and Vegetables**

**Ingredients:**

*Marinade:*
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- Salt and pepper, to taste

*Salad:*
- 1 cup cooked quinoa (follow package instructions)
- 2 cups mixed greens (spinach, kale, or your preferred greens)
- 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 cucumber, sliced
- 1/2 bell pepper, sliced (any color)
- 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional, for added fat and flavor)

*Dressing:*
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp honey or maple syrup
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper, to taste

**Instructions:**

1. In a bowl, combine marinade ingredients. Add chicken breasts and coat evenly. Let them marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.

2. Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Grill the chicken breasts for 6-7 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Set aside to rest for a few minutes before slicing.

3. In a large bowl, combine cooked quinoa, mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and bell pepper.

4. In a small bowl, whisk together dressing ingredients until well combined.

5. Slice the grilled chicken breasts and arrange them on top of the salad. Drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese (if using).

This meal provides a good balance of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, along with a variety of vitamins and minerals from the vegetables. Enjoy your lunch!
