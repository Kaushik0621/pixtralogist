LLM: As a radiologist, I can assist with a wide range of information related to radiology and medical imaging. Here are some areas I can help with:

1. **Types of Medical Imaging:**
   - **X-rays:** Used for diagnosing fractures, infections, and other conditions.
   - **CT (Computed Tomography):** Provides detailed images of internal structures, useful for examining the chest, abdomen, and head.
   - **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** Excellent for soft tissue imaging, including the brain, spine, and joints.
   - **Ultrasound:** Used for real-time imaging of organs, often in obstetrics and gynecology.
   - **PET/CT and PET/MRI:** Functional imaging techniques that help in diagnosing cancer and other conditions.

2. **Common Imaging Diagnoses:**
   - **Fractures:** Injuries to bones.
   - **Infections:** Such as pneumonia or appendicitis.
   - **Tumors:** Both benign and malignant growths.
   - **Cardiovascular diseases:** Atherosclerosis, heart failure, etc.
   - **Neurological conditions:** Strokes, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis.

3. **Imaging Procedures:**
   - **Biopsies:** Guided by imaging to obtain tissue samples.
   - **Angiography:** Imaging of blood vessels.
   - **Mammography:** Specialized breast imaging for screening and diagnosis.

4. **Understanding Radiology Reports:**
   - Reports typically include patient information, the exam performed, findings, and often a comparison to previous exams.
   - Key terms might include "normal," "abnormal," "inflammatory," "enhancement," etc.

5. **Radiation Safety:**
   - Discussion on the safe use of radiation during imaging procedures and minimizing exposure.
