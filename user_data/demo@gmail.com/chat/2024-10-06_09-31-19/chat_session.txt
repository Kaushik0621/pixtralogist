LLM: I'm sorry to hear about your injury. Here are some steps you should take:

1. **Clean the wound immediately**: Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and warm water for at least 5 minutes. This helps to remove any bacteria and reduces the risk of infection.

2. **Control bleeding**: Apply pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or bandage.

3. **Bandage the wound**: Cover the wound with a sterile bandage or clean cloth.

4. **Seek medical attention**: Even if the wound seems minor, it's important to seek medical care. Dog bites can become infected, and you may need a tetanus shot or antibiotics. Here's what to do:

   - If possible, see a healthcare professional within 24 hours.
   - If the wound is large, bleeding heavily, or showing signs of infection (redness, warmth, increased pain, or oozing), seek immediate medical attention.

5. **Pain management**: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage pain. Always follow the instructions on the package.

6. **Watch for signs of infection**: Keep an eye on the wound for any signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, warmth, or oozing.

7. **Update your tetanus vaccination**: If your last tetanus shot was more than 5 years ago, you may need a booster.

If you have any concerns or the wound worsens, don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room. They can provide further advice and treatment tailored to your specific situation.
