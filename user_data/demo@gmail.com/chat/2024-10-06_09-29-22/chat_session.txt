LLM: I'm sorry to hear about your injury. As a general practitioner, I'll provide some guidance on what you should do, but remember that this is general advice and should not replace professional medical care.

1. **Dog Bite:**
   - **Clean the wound:** Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water for at least 5 minutes. Make sure to clean around the wound as well.
   - **Apply pressure:** Use a sterile bandage or clean cloth to apply gentle pressure to the wound for 15-20 minutes to help stop any bleeding.
   - **Seek medical attention:** Even if the wound seems minor, it's important to get it checked by a healthcare professional. Dog bites can lead to infections, and in some cases, rabies if the dog is not vaccinated.
   - **Antibiotics:** Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection.
   - **Tetanus shot:** If you haven't had a tetanus booster in the last 5 years, you may need one.

2. **Knee Pain:**
   - **RICE method:** Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation can help reduce pain and swelling.
     - **Rest:** Avoid activities that cause pain, but don't stay in bed for long periods.
     - **Ice:** Apply an ice pack for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times a day.
     - **Compression:** Use a elastic bandage to wrap your knee.
     - **Elevation:** Keep your knee raised when sitting or lying down.
   - **Pain relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help.
   - **Seek medical attention:** If the pain is severe, worsens, or is accompanied by significant swelling, warmth, instability, or inability to bear weight, you should see a healthcare professional.

In your case, it's essential to get both the dog bite and the knee injury checked by a healthcare professional to ensure proper treatment and prevent potential complications.
