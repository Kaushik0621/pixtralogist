Here are some possible causes and suggestions:

1. **Upper Respiratory Infection (URI)**: A cough and vomiting can be symptoms of a common cold or flu. The stomach pain could be due to irritation from post-nasal drip.
   - Rest and hydrate.
   - Use over-the-counter cold and flu remedies.
   - Consider gargling with warm salt water to ease throat discomfort.

2. **Gastroenteritis (Stomach Flu)**: This can cause vomiting, abdominal pain, and sometimes a cough due to irritation from stomach acid.
   - Stay hydrated, sipping water frequently.
   - Consider electrolyte replacement drinks.
   - Avoid solid foods until the nausea passes, then gradually reintroduce bland foods.

3. **Food Poisoning**: This can cause stomach pain, vomiting, and sometimes a cough if irritation extends to the throat.
   - Hydrate and rest.
   - Avoid eating until symptoms improve.

4. **Pneumonia**: While less common, pneumonia can cause a cough, vomiting, and stomach pain.
   - Seek medical attention immediately.

Given the combination of symptoms, it's important to stay hydrated and monitor your condition. If symptoms worsen, such as severe abdominal pain, high fever, bloody vomit, or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention.

For more specific advice and diagnosis, it's best to consult a healthcare professional.
